#Minecraft Raspberry Pi Edition image draw

This Python script reads images and prints them as blocks in Minecraft Raspberry Pi Edition.

It should work with at least jpg or png files; I'm not sure about any others. It depends on what Python Image Library supports.

##Requirements
- Minecraft Raspberry Pi Edition
- Python Image Library (PIL)
